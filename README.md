### SETUP ###

RadiOMG has been designed especially for KTUH FM. As such, the platform in its current implementation is coupled to the brand for which it was designed. If you're interested in using this platform for your own organization, please feel free to reach out to us with any questions. 

Some caveats: The system does not currently support shows that begin and end on different days (ie. shows on air over midnight). KTUH shows are in three-hour blocks, eight per day. For shows that end at the top of the hour, please specify in the program that they end one minute before that time.

### BUILD ###

Build with the following command:
`meteor build --server=https://{url}:443 --server-only`
