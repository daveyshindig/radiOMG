    <p><b>50 Years Ago at KTUH...</b></p>

    <p>
      KTUH has been on Honolulu's FM airwaves since 1969, but do you know that
      KTUH operated as an AM "carrier current" low power operation from 1966
      until 1969? The original staff got the old Hawai'i Hall audio gear
      running, built several low power AM transmitters that attached to the
      electrical panels (the dorm building wiring served as the antennas) and
      operated a limited on air schedule to show that they could successfully
      staff and operate a radio station. A humble beginning for the 7,000 watt,
      24/7 operation of today's KTUH FM.

    <p><b>Where are They Now? We Found David Dugle!</b></p>

    <p>
      While looking online for information on some KTUH alumni I found David
        Dugle and his treasure trove of air checks from the 1970s.
    </p>
    <div class="alumni__img">

    </div>
    <p>
      David writes, "I have become a business analyst for software teams.
      I still live in California, but my current project is all the way across
      the country in Washington, DC. So how many other KTUH folks from our
      thumpin' days have you found?  Would love to re-connect with Brian Daniel
      and Bill Soares especially, but also Chip Brown and the Langdon Brothers
      if you know where they are. I actually have been working on an
      autobiography and have written quite a lot about my days at Hawaii Hall.
      That dang station changed my life!"
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      From David's podomatic site: "David Dugle (AKA Rusty Pipes in my years
      writing for the Cosmik Debris webzine) is a full time secular humanist,
      agnostic skeptic, writer, photographer, bicyclist, dad and former
      professional broadcaster. David really does read philosophy books,
      including the Bible, and likes to argue scripture with Jehovah's Witneses
      when they come to his door. He does not believe in witches, the Devil or
      creation science. He does believe in God, but says that what he calls God
      may be quite a lot different than what other people call God.
    </p>

    <p>
      "David was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, but lived many years in Honolulu where
      he started his broadcasting career. He worked for several radio stations and
      was most famous for his rock-comedy show Insanity Palace which aired on
      KPOI-FM and KTUH-FM during the 70's. David still deejays by creating
      podcasts for the Internet and by day he still DJs also, except that it
      stands for database jockey, not disc jockey."

    <p><b>Where Are They Now? Dave and Kenny Wild</b></p>
    <p>
      Dave Wild hosted the Tuesday evening jazz show on KTUH-FM in the early
      70s. His brother, Kenny, took over the Tuesday hosting duties when Dave
      moved on. Dave and Kenny were more than knowledgeable djs, however, both
      were (and are) accomplished jazz musicians ñ Dave on piano and Kenny on
      both standup and electric bass. The Dave Wild Trio played gigs at UH and
      other venues.
    </p>

    <p>Dave writes...</p>

    <p>
      "I think I started with KTUH in 1969; the old schedules would confirm
      that. I vaguely remember getting a 3rd class broadcasters license,
      somehow, in '68 or '69. The show was the Wild World of Jazz, I think on
      Tuesday nights?  Ken came in with his own edition of the show (probably in
      1970), on Thursday night I think. I think my career ended when I started
      working with Linda Ryan at the old Cavalier Restaurant, probably in the
      summer of 1970.  Ken and I both had the same problem: gigs on the nights
      we had to broadcast. I left for the Army in August 1970 but I think Ken
      kept on broadcasting for a while. He went out on the road with Seawind in
      the summer of 1972, just before I came back in August. I know I wanted to
      start up the jazz show again but my fulltime gig with Jimmy Borges (fall
      of 1972) interfered with that.  Somewhere in that period Ken also did
      several Live From KTUH shows with elements of Seawind, probably even
      before it existed (as Ox)."

    </div>
    <p>
      Dave ended up in central Texas, where he plays piano, writes and has a
      web site (about jazz) at
      <a href="http://www.wildmusic-jazz.com/">
        http://www.wildmusic-jazz.com/
      </a>. Dave picked up a Masters Degree in Jazz Studies &amp;
      Arranging/Composing along the way. There is a lot more to Dave than this,
      but you'll need to ask him to tell you more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kenny Wild was a founding member of Seawind (1972) and left UH before
      graduating to go on the road with the band. Ken and Seawind were on the
      road for several years (including a famous stay at the Fancy Moose Inn in
      Anchorage Alaska) before winding up in LA in 1975. Seawind recorded four
      albums during that period. Seawind played on KTUH's Pakalolo Patch (now
      Monday Night Live) as Limp Jelly Beans before the band left on tour. Kenny
      has been a studio musician in Los Angeles for quite a while, and has
      backed many singers, from Natalie Cole (touring band) to Gloria Estefan to
      Neil Young.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dave says, "I donít know if and when weíll be back to play in southern
      Cal. There may be something next summer, but I'm not yet sure. We'd also
      both love to go back to Honolulu again but that's a much more elusive goal."

      KTUH's General Manager at the time, Jay-me Morita, sent this URL around
      in an email and it really applies to KTUH's alumni:

    <p><b>KTUH Alumni Reunions</b></p>

    <p>
      KTUH alumni have held two reunions so far. The first, in summer, 2011,
      was held on campus on the makai Hemenway patio, with about 75 alumni and
      guests attending. We celebrated 45 years of KTUH being on the air
      (starting with the carrier-current operation in 1966).
    </p>

    <p>
      The second reunion, celebrating 45 years of FM operation, was held in
      June, 2014. A wide spectrum of ages and years at KTUH was evident.

    <p>
      What's next? Hopefully a big 50th celebration for the KTUH alumni, staff
      and listeners in 2019. Stay tuned!
